Complete Roadmap for Machine Learning
Step 1: Learn a Programming Language
Python
Sklearn (build an ML models)
Transoflow (help you build a neural network)
R Programming

Step 2: Learn Linear Algebra
You should learn Linear Algebra if you wish to master Machine Learning and become a pro!

This is essential because if you want to tune your models with maximum flexibility, you need to understand how they work, and knowing linear algebra is a must for that!

Step 4: Learn core ML Algorithms
Once you have some idea of using sklearn after learning Python, you should start looking into how these machine learning algorithms work.

Gradient Descent
Slope
Supervised vs Unsupervised learning
Reinforcement Learning
Basic Linear Regression
Working with all such similar models
Clustering

Step 5: Learn Python Libraries
Learn Numpy
Learn Pandas

step 6: Learn Deployement
To host your machine learning models with a powerful backend, you will need to learn frameworks like Django and Flask.

Streamlit and FastAPI are getting very popular in 2023 as well with a lot of companies using them for data science and Machine learning Web Apps! Docker and Kubernetes can be of great help if you want to ship and deploy your models quickly!
