# Machine Learning VS Deep Learning
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, and it emerged to address specific challenges and limitations of traditional machine learning techniques. Here are some key reasons why deep learning became prominent even though machine learning already existed:

|**1. Definition**    |A branch of AI that focuses on building algorithms that can learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.|A subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") to model complex patterns in data. Inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.|      
|**2. Data Representation**	|Relies on handcrafted features (manual feature engineering).	|Automatically learns hierarchical features from raw data.|       
|**3. Model Complexity**	|Uses simpler models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees).	|Uses complex models with many layers (e.g., deep neural networks).|       
|**4. Performance**         |Performs well on small to medium-sized datasets.	            |Excels with large datasets and complex tasks.|       
|**5. Hardware Requirements**|Can run on standard CPUs.                                   |	Requires GPUs/TPUs for efficient training.|       
|**6. Training Time**     	|Faster to train.	|Slower to train due to model complexity and large datasets.|      
|**7. Interpretability**	|More interpretable (e.g., decision trees, linear models).	|Less interpretable (considered a "black box").|
|**8. Scalability Performance**|plateaus with larger datasets.    |Scales well with big data.|
|**9. Use Cases**   	|Tabular data, small datasets, structured data.	|Unstructured data (images, audio, text), large datasets|. 
|**10. Examples**     | - Predicting customer churn using logistic regression. <br> - Classifying emails as spam or not spam using Naive Bayes. <br> - Recommending products using collaborative filtering.| - Detecting objects in self-driving car images using CNNs. <br> - Translating languages using sequence-to-sequence models (e.g., Google Translate). <br> - Generating human-like text using transformers (e.g., GPT).  |
